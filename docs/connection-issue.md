This issue because of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues. Since Page Assist is a browser extension, it needs to communicate with the server through the browser. However, the browser restricts communication between different origins. To resolve this issue, you can try the following solutions:   

## 1. Solutions 

Since Ollama has connection issues when directly accessed from the browser extension, Page Assist rewrites the request headers to make it work. However, automatic rewriting of headers only works on `http://127.0.0.1:*` and `http://localhost:*` URLs. To resolve the connection issue, you can try the following solutions:

1. Go to Page Assist and click on the `Settings` icon.

2. Click on the `Ollama Settings` tab.

3. There you will see the `Advance Ollama URL Configuration` option. You need to expand it.

4. Enable the `Enable or Disable Custom Origin URL` option.

:::tip
If Ollama is running on a different port, then change the URL in the `Custom Origin URL` field; otherwise, leave it as it is. Do not change the URL to the Ollama server URL like

5. Make sure click on the `Save` button to save the changes.

_This will resolve the connection issue, and you will be able to use Ollama without any issues on Page Assist_

## 2. Solution

You can set OLLAMA_ORIGIN=* to allow connections from any origin. Here's how to do it on different operating systems:

### Windows
1. Open Start menu and search for "Environment Variables"
2. Click "Edit the system environment variables"
3. Click "Environment Variables" button
4. Under "System Variables" click "New"
5. Set Variable name: `OLLAMA_ORIGIN` and Variable value: `*`
6. Click OK to save
7. Restart Ollama service


### MacOS

1. Open Terminal
2. Run the following command:

```bash
launchctl setenv OLLAMA_ORIGIN "*"
```
3. Restart Ollama service

### Linux
1. Open Terminal
2. Run the following command:

```bash
export OLLAMA_ORIGIN="*"
```
3. Restart Ollama service

_This will allow connections from any origin. Hopefully, this will resolve the connection issue._
