There are two types of custom prompts:

1. System Prompts
2. Quick Prompts


### System Prompts

System prompts will be set as the `system` type of prompt in the LLM. This means that the prompt will be sent to the LLM as a system prompt. This is useful for setting the context of the conversation.

### Quick Prompts

Quick prompts are quick prompts that you can use to quickly send a prompt to the LLM. You can use quick prompts by clicking on the `Quick Prompts` button in the input box.

If you put variables in the `{}` brackets, they will be selected automatically.
