## Visit websites from messages

This feature is enabled by default. If you want to disable it, you can do it from the settings.

### How it works?

When you enable internet search and input a webpage URL into the input box and send it, Page Assist will visit the website and extract the text from it. Then it will send the text to the LLM.

## Deep Search Mode

By default, `Perform Simple Internet Search` is enabled. If you want to use Deep Search Mode, you need to disable it.

Deep Search Mode will visit the website and extract the text from it. Then it will send the text to the LLM.

::: warning
The current Deep Search is not similar to ChatGPT's DeepSearch. It is a very basic implementation.
