# LM Studio

You can add LMStudio's API to Page Assist. Here's how you can do it:

1. Click on the Page Assist icon on the browser toolbar.

2. Click on the `Settings` icon.

3. Go to the `OpenAI Compatible API` tab.

4. Click on the `Add Provider` button.

5. Select `LMStudio` from the dropdown.

6. Enter the `LMStudio URL`. (by default it is `http://localhost:1234/v1`)

7. Click on the `Save` button.


::: info
You don't need to add any models since Page Assist will automatically fetch them from the LMStudio instance you have configured.

The model must be loaded in LMStudio before Page Assist can fetch it.
