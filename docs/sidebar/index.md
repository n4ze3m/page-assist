# Sidebar 

Sidebar is a really good feature of the extension. It allows you to chat with your AI model from any webpage. Rather than opening a new tab and navigating to the website, you can simply open the sidebar and chat with your AI model or ask any question about the current page.


Some browsers do not support the sidebar feature. You can check the [Browser Support](/browser-support.md) page to see if your browser is supported.

### Context menu actions

- Open Sidebar / Open Web UI — configurable under **Settings → System → Context Menu Action**. Pick whichever you prefer when right-clicking a page.
- Send to tldw_server — save the current page or link to your server for later review.
- Process (no server save) — extract content without storing it on the server.
- Transcribe Video/Audio — send the tab or link for transcription and view the transcript inside the sidebar/Media view.
- Transcribe + Summarize Video/Audio — transcribe, summarize, and show the output in the app once complete.

All ingest/transcribe actions require a connected tldw server.


### Using the keyboard shortcut

The default keyboard shortcut to open the sidebar is `Ctrl+Shift+Y`. You can change the keyboard shortcuts from the browser settings. See [Shortcut Keys](/shortcuts.md) for more information.
